## PDB Statistics

Importing and reading in csv file:

```{r}
pdb_stats <- read.csv("data_export_summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(pdb_stats)
```

-   **Q1:** What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. **92.99%**

```{r}
xray_total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdb_stats$X.ray)))
em_total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdb_stats$EM)))
n_total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdb_stats$Total)))
xray_em_percent <- ((xray_total + em_total)/n_total)*100
xray_em_percent
```

-   **Q2:** What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein? **86.81%**

```{r}
protein_total <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdb_stats[1,7]))
protein_percentage <- (protein_total/n_total)*100
protein_percentage
```

-   **Q3:** Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB? **204,352 structures**

## Mol\* Exploration

**Q4**: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure? **The hydrogen atoms are not resolved in X-ray crystallography hence only the oxygen molecule is used to represent water.**

**Q5**: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have? **HOH 308**

Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure:

**Q6**: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend *"Ball & Stick"* for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

# Intro to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb

attributes(pdb)
head(pdb$atom)
```

-   **Q7:** How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? **198 residues**

-   **Q8:** Name one of the two non-protein residues? **HOH**

-   **Q9:** How many protein chains are in this structure? **2 protein chains**

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure by normal mode analysis

New protein: Adenylate Kinase

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk

m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Creating movie of protein structure to view in Mol\*:

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase

```{r}
# Install packages in the R console NOT your Rmd/Quarto file

#install.packages("bio3d")
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("BiocManager")

#BiocManager::install("msa")
#devtools::install_bitbucket("Grantlab/bio3d-view")
```

-   **Q10.** Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? **msa**

-   **Q11.** Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN? **None of them**

-   **Q12.** True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? **True**

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

**Q13.** How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e.Â how long is this sequence? **214 amino acids**
