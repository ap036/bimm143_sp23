## Importing Candy Data

```{r}
candy_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

-   **Q1**. How many different candy types are in this dataset? **85**

```{r}
dim(candy)
```

-   **Q2**. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset? **38**

```{r}
sum(candy["fruity"])
```

# Finding Favorite Candy

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

-   **Q3**. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it's `winpercent` value?

```{r}
candy["Hershey's Kisses", ]$winpercent
```

-   **Q4**. What is the `winpercent` value for "Kit Kat"?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

-   **Q5**. What is the `winpercent` value for "Tootsie Roll Snack Bars"?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

Using the skimr package:

```{r}
#install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
skim(candy)
```

-   **Q6**. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset? **winpercent is on a different scale as it goes from 0 to 100, all the others only range form 0 to 1.**

<!-- -->

-   **Q7**. What do you think a zero and one represent for the `candy$chocolate` column? **0 indicates that the candy does not have chocolate and the 1 means that it does.**

# Graphing Data

-   **Q8**. Plot a histogram of `winpercent` values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy, aes(winpercent, binwidth = 30)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

-   **Q9**. Is the distribution of `winpercent` values symmetrical? **No, it is skewed to the right**

-   **Q10**. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%? **Below 50%**

-   **Q11**. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy? **Chocolate is ranked higher**

```{r}
chocolate_mean <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
chocolate_mean
fruity_mean <- mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
fruity_mean
```

-   **Q12**. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
choc_fruit <- t.test(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)],candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
choc_fruit
```

```{r}
boxplot(candy)
```

```{r}
t_nums <- factor(candy$chocolate)
t_nums <- factor(candy$fruity)
levels(t_nums) <- list(Chocolate = "0", Fruity = "1")

candy_box <- ggplot(candy) +
  aes(t_nums, winpercent) +
  geom_boxplot()

candy_box + labs(y= "Winpercent", x = "Candy Types")
```

# Overall Candy Rankings

-   **Q13**. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

-   **Q14**. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

-   **Q15**. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on `winpercent` values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

-   **Q16**. This is quite ugly, use the `reorder()` function to get the bars sorted by `winpercent`?

```{r}

my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
  
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill = my_cols)
```

-   **Q17**. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy? **Sixlets**

-   **Q18**. What is the best ranked fruity candy? **Starburst**

# Exploring pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

-   **Q19**. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of `winpercent` for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck? **Reese's miniatures**

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

-   **Q20**. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular? **Nik L Nip**

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

-   **Q21**. Make a barplot again with `geom_col()` this time using `pricepercent` and then improve this step by step, first ordering the x-axis by value and finally making a so called "dot chat" or "lollipop" chart by swapping `geom_col()` for `geom_point()` + `geom_segment()`.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(pricepercent, reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent)) +
  geom_segment(aes(yend = reorder(rownames(candy), pricepercent), 
                   xend = 0), col="gray40") +
    geom_point()
```

# Correlation Structures

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

-   **Q22**. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)? **Chocolate and fruity**

-   **Q23**. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated? **Chocolate and bar or chocolate and winpercent**

# Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = T)
summary(pca)
```

Base Plotting PCA results:

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

Using ggplot for PCA results:

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])

p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

Generating interactive plots:

```{r}
#library(plotly)

#ggplotly(p)
#Could not export as pdf due to this interactive graph, attached png of graph below.
```

![](images/newplot.png)

PCA contributions plot:

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

-   **Q24**. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you? **Fruity, hard, and pluribus are first picked up and this makes sense as PCA1 shows the highest variance among the variables.**
